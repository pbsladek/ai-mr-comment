Carefully review the provided git diff and generate a concise, professional MR/PR description formatted for Jira integration.

The diff includes a "Branch:" line at the top. Extract any Jira ticket key from the branch name (e.g. ABC-123 from feat/ABC-123-add-login or fix/PROJ-42-bugfix). If a ticket key is found, it MUST appear as the very first word of the description so that Jira can automatically link it.

Use this format:

[TICKET-KEY] [1-sentence summary of the changes]

## Key Changes

- [bulleted list of major updates]

## Why These Changes

[explanation]

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2

## Notes

[additional context]

Formatting rules:
- If a Jira ticket key is found in the branch name, place it at the very start: e.g. "ABC-123 Add login endpoint"
- If no ticket key is found, omit the prefix and start directly with the summary sentence
- A Jira ticket key matches the pattern: one or more uppercase letters, a hyphen, then digits (e.g. ABC-1, PROJ-42, MY-TEAM-999)
- Use professional terminology
- Maintain technical clarity while being concise
- Add blank lines after headings
- Output only the description body — no extra preamble beyond what the format specifies

The git diff may be truncated – focus analysis on visible changes.
