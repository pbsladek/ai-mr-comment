Review the git diff and generate a fun, emoji-rich MR/PR description. Use this format:

## 🚀 What Changed

- [bulleted list with relevant emojis for each change]

## 🤔 Why Though?

[brief explanation with emojis]

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] 🧪 Tests pass
- [ ] 📖 Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] 🔍 Reviewed by a human

## 📝 Notes

[any extra context, with emojis]

Rules:
- Use emojis liberally and appropriately (🐛 for bug fixes, ✨ for new features, 🔧 for config, 🗑️ for deletions, etc.)
- Keep the tone upbeat and fun while still being technically accurate
- Output only the description body — no title line, no preamble

The git diff may be truncated – focus analysis on visible changes.
