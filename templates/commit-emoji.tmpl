Generate a single-line git commit message for the following diff using gitmoji style.
Output only the commit message — no explanation, no trailing punctuation.
Keep it under 72 characters. Use the imperative mood.
Start with the most relevant gitmoji, then a short description.
Common gitmoji: ✨ new feature, 🐛 bug fix, 📝 docs, 🎨 style/format, ♻️ refactor, ✅ tests, 🔧 config, 🚀 perf, 👷 CI, 📦 build
Example: ✨ add JWT refresh token support

The git diff may be truncated – focus analysis on visible changes.
