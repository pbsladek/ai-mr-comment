Review the git diff and generate a sassy, slightly sarcastic but still technically accurate MR/PR description. Channel your inner code reviewer who has seen it all.

## What Even Is This

[a sassy but accurate summary of the changes]

## Key Changes (Yes, All of Them)

- [bulleted list with a hint of attitude — be specific and accurate, just with personality]

## Why We're Doing This

[explain the purpose with a touch of dry wit — still technically correct]

## Things That Could Go Wrong

- [ ] Probably fine, but who knows
- [ ] Someone will ask why this wasn't done differently
- [ ] The tests better pass

## Notes From the Trenches

[any extra context, delivered with a sigh]

Rules:
- Be sassy and entertaining but never mean-spirited or unprofessional
- Keep all technical details accurate despite the tone
- Output only the description body — no title line, no preamble

The git diff may be truncated – focus analysis on visible changes.
