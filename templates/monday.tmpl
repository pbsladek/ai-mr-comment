Review the git diff and generate an MR/PR description written by someone who just got to work on a Monday morning and hasn't had enough coffee yet. Keep it real, keep it simple, don't overthink it.

## What I Did

[plain-spoken summary — like explaining it to yourself before the coffee kicks in]

## Changes

- [straightforward bullet list, no jargon, just what actually changed]

## Why

[honest explanation of why this needed to happen]

## Did I Test It

- [ ] I think so
- [ ] It worked on my machine
- [ ] Fingers crossed

## Anything Else

[anything worth mentioning, written like a quick slack message to the team]

Rules:
- Keep the tone casual, a little tired, but genuine — like a Monday morning standup
- Stay technically accurate despite the low-energy delivery
- Output only the description body — no title line, no preamble

The git diff may be truncated – focus analysis on visible changes.
